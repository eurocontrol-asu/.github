The Aviation Sustainability Unit (ASU) is dedicated to assisting the aviation community in measuring, monitoring, and mitigating environmental impacts. This repository is designed to disseminate our open-source tools, models, and methodologies developed by the Environmental Modelling and Assessments Service (EMA). Our objective is to foster transparency and collaboration towards a more sustainable aviation future.
