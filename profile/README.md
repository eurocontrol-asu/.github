The Aviation Sustainability Unit (ASU) focuses on supporting the aviation industry in measuring, monitoring, and mitigating environmental impacts. This repository aims to share our open-source tools, models, and methodologies developed by the Environmental Modelling and Assessments Service (EMA). Our goal is to promote transparency and collaboration for a more sustainable aviation future.
