The Aviation Sustainability Unit (ASU) is focused on helping the aviation community measure, monitor and mitigate environmental impacts. This repository aims to share our open source tools, models and methodologies developed by the Environmental Modelling and Assessments Service (EMA). Our goal is to promote transparency and collaboration for a more sustainable aviation future.
